      - uses: spring-io/spring-doc-actions/update-antora-spring-ui@{ACTION_VERSION}

        with:
          docs-branch: 'docs-build'
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
----

The PR will only be created if there is no open PR for the same branch, even if there is a newer version of Antora UI Spring.
For example, if there is an open PR to update from version `v0.4.11` to `v0.4.12` and `v0.4.13` is released, the workflow won't open a new PR for `v0.4.13` if the previous one is not closed.
